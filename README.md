# LinkedIn Company Filter

## Overview

For some reason LinkedIn has a filter to include only specific companies, but not exclude. This extension is primarily useful for hiding job postings from companies that are just redirects to other job posting sites, or very clearly just scams.

I found it most useful when searching by time posted and a company has posted 20 of the same job postings within the same hour.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Enable Developer Mode in your browser:**

   - **Google Chrome:**

     - Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
     - Toggle the switch for "Developer mode" in the top right corner.

   - **Microsoft Edge:**
     - Open Edge and navigate to `edge://extensions/`.
     - Toggle the switch for "Developer mode" in the bottom left corner.

3. **Load the unpacked extension:**

   - Click on "Load unpacked" and select the cloned repository folder.

4. **Start using LinkedIn Company Filter:**
   - Once the extension is loaded, can pin it to the extension bar and add company names to filter them out.
   - Removing companies from the exclude list will unhide them.
   - Make sure to use the exact company name with no extra spaces.
